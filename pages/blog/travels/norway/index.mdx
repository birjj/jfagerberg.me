Rondane in central Norway is the oldest national park in the
country. It's a beautiful place, slightly flatter and with more lenient trails
than the neighboring Jotunheimen national park. I visited during the fall of 2018,
joining a small group of newer hikers on a week-long backpacking trip around the
perimeter of the park.

As is common in Norway, the trekking facilities in the park are
exceedingly well maintained. It is difficult to get lost with DNT's iconic 'T's
dotting the trails, and with both manned and unmanned huts available the park is
accessible to everyone, regardless of skill level.

We started near the southern border of the park, following the trails counter-clockwise.
Circling around the central mountain of Rondeslottet offers some incredible views.
With the fall colors in full swing it was a delightful mix of valleys and mountain ridges,
rivers and snow-covered fields.

Our little group chose to sleep in our tents most nights, pitching where possible
along rivers or near mountain lakes. Come the second-to-last night, following a
day of heavy rain and worn out feet, we decided to indulge ourselves a bit and
rent one of the cozy huts near [Peer
Gynt-hytta](https://www.visitnorway.dk/listings/peer-gynt-hytta-i-rondane-nasjonalpark/199463/) -
a group of delightful little huts, full of the charm of decades past.

I can fully recommend taking a hike through Rondane if backpacking is something
that interests you. You can easily adapt the trip depending on your skill and
comfort level, whether you prefer sleeping in well-maintained huts or out in the
open, and regardless of how many height meters your legs can take in a day. As
with any mountain range it is important not to take it too casually - but Rondane
is definitely one of the more friendly backpacking trips I've been on.

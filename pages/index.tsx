          title="RPA developer at Odense University Hospital"

          <p>
            Responsible for automatization of work processes across the hospital
            using the{" "}
            <Link href="https://sirenia.eu/products/rpa/">Manatee</Link> RPA
            application. Had ownership of the entire process, from customer
            communication to final implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the RPA team was newly formed when I joined, and I was the most
            experienced developers, I became responsible for the development of
            work processes, developer tools and documentation in order to
            improve the DX and productivity of the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            This evolved into being responsible for multiple internal department
            projects, handling design, server management and development.

        <WorkHistory

          title="Frontend developer at CleanManager"
        >
          <p>
            As sole frontend developer I was initially tasked with implementing
            new features and SPA's, and later spearheaded the effort to
            modernize the entire frontend codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            This included a complete rewrite and redesign of our system and
            workflow from an old custom-built ES5 implementation to one built on
            React and ES6.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually the team expanded with several new frontend developers,
            and I transitioned into a more senior role with responsibility for
            the frontend rewrite of our calendar module.

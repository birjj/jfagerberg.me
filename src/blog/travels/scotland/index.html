            <h1>West Highland Way</h1>
            <small>May, 2017 ⋅ Scotland</small>

            The West Highland Way is the most well-known long-distance trails in
            Scotland. It's a wonderful trip through everything Scotland has to
            offer, starting off in the beautiful rolling hills of Milngavie near
            Glasgow, continuing north past Loch Lomond, and ending in Fort
            William just past the very first mountains of the highlands.

            It's a uniquely social trip. Since the trail is so popular, towns
            have sprung up everywhere that people end the day; with these
            logical places to spend the night, you naturally end up roughly
            following the pace of those around you. With how friendly everyone
            is, striking up a conversation on one of the first days is
            guaranteed to get you a walking partner for however long you wish.

            It's an incredible experience and one of my favorite backpacking
            trips. The trail itself is extremely beginner-friendly, with hostels
            and baggage transfer available if that's your thing. I would
            wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone even remotely interested in
            hiking.

                <h1>Cairngorms National Park</h1>
                <small>March, 2017 ⋅ Scotland</small>
            </centered-title>

            The Cairngorms National Park consists of a small mountain range
            nestled between the towns of Aviemore and Braemar. The area is
            excellent for rock and ice climbing, and is home to a significant
            mountaineering community - but also features a couple of trails
            around and across the central mountains. The trek around the
            mountains starts off relatively simply, following the western edge
            of the mountain range. Starting in Aviemore, the trail passes
            through woodland for the first day or so, and then leaves
            civilization behind as it mirrors the movements of River Feshie.

                <img

                />
            </picture-grid>

            After approaching the southern side of the mountains, the way back
            goes through the central mountain pass, Lairig Ghru. This makes for
            some slightly more challenging hiking, but nothing that can't easily
            be completed within a day.

            </picture-grid>

            The area is seldom used for backpacking, with most activity being
            related to skiing, rock climbing or mountain biking. If you are
            looking to backpack in Scotland, I would recommend picking the
            highlands or West Highland Way over the Cairngorms; but it is
            nonetheless a relaxing 3-4 day hike with decently varying nature.

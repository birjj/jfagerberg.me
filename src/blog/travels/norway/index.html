                <h1>Rondane National Park</h1>
                <small>September, 2018 ⋅ Norway</small>
            </div>

            Rondane in central Norway is the oldest national park in the
            country. It's a beautiful place, with slightly easier trecking than
            in the neighboring Jotunheimen national park. I visited during fall,
            backpacking around the park for a week along with a group of newer
            hikers.

            As is common in Norway, the trekking facilities in the park are
            exceedingly well maintained. The trails themselves are marked by
            DNT's iconic 'T's, and both manned and unmanned huts are available
            in the more well-traveled parts.

            </picture-grid>

            With the fall colors in full swing, the views were absolutely
            stunning. I would definitely recommend this trip for anyone
            interested in hiking, or simply exploring the Norwegian mountains
            without having to climb any. There are plenty of huts throughout the
            park, so you can choose between backpacking or day hiking - or just
            use them to seek refuge from the rain as we did in the wonderfully
            charming huts near [Peer
            Gynt-hytta](https://www.visitnorway.dk/listings/peer-gynt-hytta-i-rondane-nasjonalpark/199463/).

                <h1>Jotunheimen National Park</h1>
                <small>August, 2018 ⋅ Norway</small>
            </div>

            Jotunheimen is probably best known for the striking contrast of the
            lakes of Gjende and Bessvatnet; separated by the 400m vertical drop
            of the mountain ridge Besseggen, the two lakes are strikingly
            differently colored owing to the glacial water in Gjende and lack of
            same in Bessvatnet. The path along Besseggen is one of the most
            popular walks in Norway and attracts a significant amount of
            tourists. The rest of Jotunheimen is somewhat less traveled, with
            the exception of Galdhøpiggen - Norway's tallest mountain.

            I went to Jotunheimen for a solo backpacking trip, starting with
            Besseggen and then proceeding off the normal trail onto the less
            traveled outskirts. The plan was to make my way to the nearby
            Glittertind, Norway's second tallest mountain at just 3 meters less
            than Galdhøpiggen. Nestled between two popular mountain lodges, the
            fairly easy trail to the summit is also one of the more trafficked
            mountain trails in Norway. At the very summit is a glacier, which
            has led to some debate about which of the mountains is taller. It
            used to be that, counting the glacier, Glittertind was quite a bit
            taller than Galdhøpiggen - but "luckily" the glacier has shrunk
            enough to undisputably give Galdhøpiggen the title.

            The remainder of the trip was fairly run of the mill, passing
            through valleys and mountain passes as I circled my way back.
            Despite this latter half of the trip being plagued by rain and some
            unnecessarily strenuous days owing to mistakes on my part, this trip
            was a great experience. For anyone who, like me, has a bit of a
            mountain fetish, Jotunheimen is a must-visit for any hiking trip in
            Norway.

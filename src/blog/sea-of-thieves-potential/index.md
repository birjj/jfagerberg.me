title: Sea of Thieves: a Tale of Wasted Potential
type: blog

---

You could write many blog posts about Sea of Thieves; hours could be spent discussing its incredible graphics, or its unique role as a social sandbox that makes it the perfect catalyst for wasting hours with friends. This blog post will not be about any of these.

You see, Sea of Thieves has a problem. In spite of the incredible talent that went into the graphics and the sound design, there is one area in which the game lags so far behind that it almost invalidates every other aspect: game design.

## Problem #1: Lack of Engaging Core Loop

The core loop that Sea of Thieves is built upon is relatively simple. Despite the fact that you can choose between doing missions from one of the three factions in the game, or participating in the currently active global event, the core loop remains the same:

1. Sail to point of interest
2. Fight skeletons (possibly in a fort) / Follow "X marks the spot" map / Sell items
3. Repeat

With such a simple core loop, the importance of each core mechanic being engaging increases greatly. Unfortunately, the mechanics listed above are more reminiscent of those found in _"go kill/collect 25 of X"_ quests known from MMORPGs - which are famous examples of poor game design - and offer a similarly minimal level of engagement.

That's not to say Sea of Thieves is devoid of fun. The core loop only makes up half of what the game entails: the interactions with other players makes up the other half, and those are significantly more interesting. Nonetheless, _someone_ has to subject themselves to playing the game itself for there to be any loot to fight with other players over.

## Problem #2: A Promise of Carrots

/_ gameplay should be fun and engaging in and of itself, not something to power through for the sake of a potential reward at the end _/

## Problem #3: Repetition, Repetition, Repetition

/_ the entire game consists of the same exact mechanics over and over, either questing (3 variants) or forting _/

## Problem #4: The Grind of the Decade

/_ takes an immense amount of work to do any progress, and there are no goals to work towards _/

## Problem #5: Difficulty through Frustration

/_ most additional difficulty is added through obstacles that make it harder to play (e.g. earthquakes and volcanos) _/

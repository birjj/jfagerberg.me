        I'm a JavaScript developer with an interest in security, online privacy
        and automation. I enjoy implementing tools that help improve the
        development experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also spend some of my time maintaining open source projects. I've been
        involved in projects such as <a
          href="https://simpleicons.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Icons</a
        > and <a

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">SweetAlert2</a
        >, amongst others. I also have a lot of smaller projects, some of which
        you can see below.

        When I have the time, and have something interesting to share, I write
        on <a href="/blog/">my blog</a>.

            RPA developer at Odense University Hospital

          <p>
            The RPA team was newly formed when I joined, and I was the most
            experienced developer. I consequently became responsible for the
            development of work processes, developer tools and documentation in
            order to improve the DX and productivity of the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            This evolved into a full-stack role for multiple internal projects.

            Frontend developer at CleanManager

          <p>
            A small startup, in which I acted as sole frontend developer. In
            addition to the on-going frontend work, I was primarily focused on
            modernizing the codebase.

            This was during the early days of React, and our existing solution
            started to show its disadvantages as more members joined the team.
            As such, my role eventually transitioned entirely to transitioning
            our platform to React.

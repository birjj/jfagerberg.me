    <h1>Rondane National Park</h1>
    <small>September, 2018 ⋅ Norway</small>
</centered-title>

Rondane in central Norway is the oldest national park in the country. With slightly more tame nature than the nearby Jotunheimen, the park is an excellent place for beginner trekkers or simply those who prefer less vertical hiking.

As is common in Norway, the trekking facilities in the park are exceedingly well maintained. The trails themselves are marked by DNT's iconic 'T's, and both manned and unmanned huts are available in the more well-travelled parts.

The trip was definitely enjoyable, especially with the fall colors bringing a dash of life - but as a bit of a mountain fetishist it was difficult not to compare it to the views from Jotunheimen that I had just returned home from.

    <h1>Jotunheimen National Park</h1>
    <small>August, 2018 ⋅ Norway</small>

Jotunheimen is probably best known for the striking contrast of the lakes of Gjende and Bessvatnet: with a vertical separation of almost 400m, the two lakes feature strikingly different colors while only being separated by the mountain ridge of Besseggen.

The path along Besseggen is one of the most popular walks in Norway, and attracts a significant amount of tourists. The rest of Jotunheimen is somewhat less travelled, but features some beautiful and accessible mountain views nonetheless.

My trip consisted of a circular path through Jotunheimen, starting with a trip over Besseggen. Beyond that was some more solitary hiking, until I made it close to Glittertind - the second highest mountain in Norway. Although most interest is pointed at the nearby and slightly taller Galdhøpiggen, Glittertind is certainly a majestic sight.

The remainder of the trip was fairly run of the mill, although the rain and cold did make some of the mountain passes slightly sketchy. By the time I had made it back to Gjende, a nights stay in one of the huts maintained by DNT was most welcome.

  <figcaption class="left">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</figcaption>

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Where does it come from?

<Aside>
  This article is talking about Lorem Ipsum, which is neat.
</Aside>

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

  Lorem Ipsum is a format for filler text, useful for filling out kitchen sink blog posts.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

### Mathematics

You can write $math$ using dollar signs, which gets rendered using $\KaTeX$. $\frac{1}{2}$ is a fraction.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

This also supports aligned code, matrices, complex environments, etc. through $\KaTeX$. See [their list of supported environments](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html#environments) for more.

$$
\begin{align}
a&=b+c \\
d+e&=f
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{CD}
   A @>a>> B \\
@VbVV @AAcA \\
   C @= D
\end{CD}
$$

    argnames = func.func_code.co_varnames[:func.func_code.co_argcount]
    fname = func.func_name
    def echo_func(*args,**kwargs):
        print fname, ":", ', '.join(
            '%s=%r' % entry
            for entry in zip(argnames,args) + kwargs.items())
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

### Collapsed Section

The following uses the [`<details>`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections) tag to create a collapsed section.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Shopping list (click me!)</summary>

This is content inside a `<details>` dropdown.
